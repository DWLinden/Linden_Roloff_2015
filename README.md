# Linden & Roloff (2015) - corrigendum
[Linden &amp; Roloff (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1618/full) described an approach to specifying a prior variance for regression coefficients that attempted to follow the approach used by [Link &amp; Barker (2006)](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/prodabs/ab10060307/6623_Link.pdf).  The description and implementation in Linden &amp; Roloff (2015) were incorrect.

Link &amp; Barker (2006) discuss the problems associated with vague priors, and illustrate a simple example where the prior variance has an influence on model selection (Figure 2).  We illustrated a similar issue in [Figure 4](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/figures/doi/10.1002/ece3.1618#figure-viewer-ece31618-fig-0005) of Linden &amp; Roloff (2015) where increasing the prior variance to arbitrarily large values for regression coefficients caused the inclusion probabilities to decrease for those $beta parameters with variable support.  The solution presented by Link &amp; Barker (2006) (hereafter, the L&B prior) was to define a total variance (V) for the linear predictor and partition that variance among each regression parameter depending on how many parameters are included in the predictor.

an apprOur original description of the prior was wrong...
