# Linden & Roloff (2015) - corrigendum
[Linden &amp; Roloff (2015)](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ece3.1618/full) described an approach to specifying a prior variance for regression coefficients that attempted to follow the approach used by [Link &amp; Barker (2006)](https://www.pwrc.usgs.gov/prodabs/ab10060307/6623_Link.pdf).  The description and implementation in Linden &amp; Roloff (2015) were incorrect.

Link &amp; Barker (2006) discuss the problems associated with vague priors, and illustrate a simple example where the prior variance has an influence on model selection (Figure 2).  We illustrated a similar issue in [Figure 5](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/enhanced/figures/doi/10.1002/ece3.1618#figure-viewer-ece31618-fig-0005) of Linden &amp; Roloff (2015) where increasing the prior variance to arbitrarily large values for regression coefficients caused the inclusion probabilities to decrease for those parameters that did not have very strong support.  The solution presented by Link &amp; Barker (2006) (hereafter, the L&B prior) was to define a total variance (V) for the linear predictor and partition that variance among each regression parameter depending on how many parameters are included in the predictor.  Thus, the prior variance for a given parameter was defined as V/(k+1), where k is the number of regression coefficients included in a model, not including the intercept (hence the +1).

Our application of the L&B prior incorrectly partitioned a single variance equally to all parameters from the dynamic multistate model.  If following the logic of Link &amp; Barker (2006) we should have specified multiple variances, one for each of the 5 linear predictors that had regression coefficients with inclusion uncertainty.  Additionally, the `JAGS` code
